    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Mugabel family owned a modest used car lot in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, dealing primarily in reliable and affordable vehicles.
        Over the years, their business managed to carve out a niche in a market that appreciated value and practicality.
        However, as the automotive market evolved and competition increased, the family recognized a need to diversify their business.
        In 2021, Ibraheem Mugabel, the eldest son, relocated to the U.S. with an idea: to establish a similar used car dealership in
        Seattle, focusing on affordable imported cars and providing value to budget-conscious consumers. His father, Hashem, provided 
        financial backing, while his younger brother, AlBaraa, continued to manage the family's original lot in Riyadh.
