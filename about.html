    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Mugabel family owned a modest used car lot in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, dealing primarily in reliable and affordable vehicles.
        <br> Over the years, their business managed to carve out a niche in a market that appreciated value and practicality.
        <br> However, as the automotive market evolved and competition increased, the family recognized a need to diversify their business.
        <br> In 2021, Ibraheem Mugabel, the eldest son, relocaed to the U.S. with an idea: to establish a similar used car dealership in
        <br> Seattle, focusing on affordable imported cars and providing value to budget-conscious consumers. His father, Hashem, provided 
        <br>financial backing, while his younger brother, AlBaraa, continued to manage the family's original lot in Riyadh.
        <br> Starting a business in the U.S. posed significant challenges for Ibraheem. He encountered strict regulations, licensing
        <br> requirements, and a completely different market landscape. Initially, he took a job at a local dealership in Seattle to
        <br> learn about the American automotive market. After gaining two years of experience, he opened "Fadak Auto", a dealership
        <br> that specialized in offering a mix of used imported and domestic vehicles that appealed to a wide range of buyers in Seattle.
        <br> Word of the dealership's value-driven approach spread, attracting a diverse clientele including immigrants, students, and
        <br> local residents looking for good deals. Back in Riyadh, Albaraa adapted the family business to better utilize digital platforms,
        <br> expanding their visibility and customer base throughout the region.
        <br>
        <br> Despite the physical distance, the Mugabel brothers maintained the entrepreneurial spirit of their family. Their dealerships
        <br> in Riyadh and Seattle exemplified their ability to adapt and thrive in different markets through a shared commitment to their
        <br> community and customers.
